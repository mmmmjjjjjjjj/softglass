  <h1>Hello SOFTglass</h1>
  <h2>The S.O.F.T. (Sonification Of Flowing Temporality) Glass<br>
    <br>
    Hai gurlThe SOFTglass is an hourglass that makes and manipulates sound. <br> 
    In its final form, it will be a sculptural object that can double as <br>
    a musical instrument, based on the simple and enduring <br>
    timekeeping device dating back at least to the 16th <br>
    century BC. Utilizing a variety of sensor types, the final <br>
    form will be an interactive object that users can treat as a <br>
    sound-maker or a timepiece. When treated as a <br>
    timepiece, the passage of time becomes marked by the <br>
    eventual absence of sound. <br><br>
    During this difficult time, realizing this project as a <br>
    physical object for the attendees of Expo to play with is <br>
    no longer feasible. I'll get there. We'll get there. But for <br>
    now, please enjoy this 3D model developed specifically <br>
    for Expo. <br><br>
    This project would not have been possible without the <br>
    contributions of the following Calarts faculty and <br>
    students: Charlie Danner, Michael Darling, Ajay Kapur, <br>
    Michael Liesz, Andrew Piepenbrink, and Dexter Shepherd. <br>
    Additional acknowledgements to my mentor, Madeline Falcone, <br>
    and the Calarts Student Union for partially funding this <br>
    project. And most importantly, thank you to my family <br>
    and loved ones for your endless love and support.
